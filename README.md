The code running my christmas lights

This is mostly here just so I know where to find it next year, but it may or maynot be useful to you.

It's all running on Circuit Python. One string is run on a Circuit Playground Express plugged into a Cricket. The Cricket is overkill, but I had one and it give screw terminals. This is running the Rainbow Cycle code from the Adafruit examples (I'll add the script here later)

The other is running on a Metro ESP32-S2 with a shild on top with the NeoPixel wires soldered on. This is running the twinkling script that makes individual NeoPixels light up periodically. Probably needs a few more colours though.

Now have a pixel blaze powered strip on my bookshelf as well running a modified version of fireflies.
